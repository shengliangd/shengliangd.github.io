Hi, I'm Shengliang Deng.
I'm currently a Ph.D. student at [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/), advised by [Prof. Heming Cui](https://www.cs.hku.hk/~heming).
I received my B.Eng. degree from [The University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/).

I enjoy facing challenges and difficulties that originate from real-world problems.
My academic journey began with a focus on robotic systems and networking. However, as time passed, I came to realize that the major roadblocks of robotics & autonomous driving lie in end-to-end applications, algorithms, and engineering practices, instead of scheduling, networking, computational efficiency, etc.
Therefore, I paused my Ph.D. study to gain a deeper understanding of real-world problems through industry internships.

During the past months at Momenta, I designed and developed a powerful & easy-to-use debugging platform from scratch, significantly alleviating the burdens faced by both the R&D and road test teams.
Recently, I'm exploring new possibilities in Tusen.
I'm also actively learning and sharing about recent breakthroughs in AI and robotics-related area. If you are interested, welcome to [my BiliBili homepage](https://space.bilibili.com/384976643/video)!
