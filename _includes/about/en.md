Hi, I'm Shengliang Deng.
I'm a Ph.D. student at [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/), advised by [Prof. Heming Cui](https://www.cs.hku.hk/~heming).
I received my B.Eng. degree from [The University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/).

I enjoy tackling challenges and difficulties.
My academic journey began with a focus on robotic systems and networking. However, as time passed, I came to realize that the major roadblocks of contemporary robotics arise from algorithms and engineering practices, instead of scheduling, networking, etc.
Therefore, I paused my Ph.D. study during 2023 to gain a deeper understanding of real-world problems, through industry internships in Momenta and TuSimple, and had a wonderful engineering journey.

With a strong engineering background and a passion for learning new things, in early 2024, I was privileged to start collaborating with esteemed researchers from [Galbot](https://www.galbot.com/) and [BAAI](https://www.baai.ac.cn/) on building generalizable vision-language-action models (VLAs).
Our goal is to develop generalizable skills and embodied models to facilitate embodied AGI.
