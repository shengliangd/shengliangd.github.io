Hi, I'm Shengliang Deng.
I'm a Ph.D. student (but currently on leave) at [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/), advised by [Prof. Heming Cui](https://www.cs.hku.hk/~heming).
I received my B.Eng. degree from [The University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/).

I enjoy tackling challenges and difficulties.
My academic journey began with a focus on robotic systems and networking. However, as time passed, I came to realize that the major roadblocks of robotics & autonomous driving lie in algorithms and engineering practices, instead of scheduling, networking, etc.
Therefore, I paused my Ph.D. study to gain a deeper understanding of real-world problems through industry internships.

During the past months at Momenta, I designed and developed a powerful & easy-to-use debugging platform from scratch, significantly alleviating the burdens faced by both the R&D and road test teams. Recently, I’m having a new internship in Tusen.

I’m also exploring the possibility of making contributions in AI interpretability, especially for large language models (LLM) (though much to catch up!). I believe they are vital given the rapid development of LLM-based applications. I also share interesting things I learned via short videos, search for user '\_\_起名太难\_\_' on BiliBili if you are interested!
