Hi, I'm Shengliang Deng.
I'm a Ph.D. student at [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/), advised by [Prof. Heming Cui](https://www.cs.hku.hk/~heming).
I received my B.Eng. degree from [The University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/).

I enjoy tackling challenges and difficulties.
My academic journey began with a focus on robotic systems and networking. However, as time passed, I came to realize that the major roadblocks of contemporary robotics arise from algorithms and engineering practices, instead of scheduling, networking, etc.
Therefore, I paused my Ph.D. study during 2023 to gain a deeper understanding of real-world problems, through industry internships in Momenta and Tusimple, and had a wonderful engineering journey.

With a strong engineering background and a high aptitude for learning new things, in early 2024, I was privileged to collaborate on embodied multimodal LLMs with esteemed researchers from [BAAI](https://www.baai.ac.cn/) and [Galbot](https://www.galbot.com/).
Our goal is to develop generalizable skills and embodied models for robots to facilitate embodied AGI.

As a Ph.D. student, I believe we researchers should focus on finding generalizable and robust solutions to challenging problems under practical settings, if not working on fundamental theories.
This process could be time-consuming and sometimes painful, but it ultimately leads to long-lasting advancements beyond papers.
I must candidly admit that my initial phase of Ph.D. studies did not quite reflect this ideal.
However, I am trying my best to align my future work more closely with these principles.

<!-- With the purpose of solving valuable and practical problems, I am always open to learn new things on demand. Currently, my technical skills span across deep learning, robotics simulation, Docker, Linux usage & kernel hacking, ROS, and a little bit about front-end development. -->
